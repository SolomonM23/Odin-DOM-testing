This is practice on querySelectors and Events with a sample file from the Odin Project.

The exercise itself is to append some nodes under the parent container div, create a div inside the container, and append nodes to that internal div only using javascript.

the second portion was a test for me to add a button in the HTML and then add event listeners to it in Javascript.

At the bottom, I also tested out the event listener properties with the e.target.
